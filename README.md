# Base-Encryption-and-Decryption
Encryption and Decryption This program encrypts any message into any base from binary to hexadecimal and back. 

Challenges and Solutions: -	Knowing when to end the input stream without a sentinel value using built in python functions (stdin) -	Efficiently coding the encryption methods avoiding repetitive/non-optimal if statements for a faster more scalable program. -	Decrypting the proper message with white spaces and punctuation in their correct places for every base -	Creating a easy to use user interface to select either the encryption or decryption for the respective message in a respective base.
